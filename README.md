# Portfolio-Website
<p> Live site <a href="https://cyberohn2.github.io/Portfolio-Website/">Here</a>
This is a website where I'll be uploading live preview of my projects. For now the projects there are placeholders,
<h2>Built with sass and vanilla js</h2>
<li>But i had to use <a href="https://www.sassmeister.com/">SassMeister</a> to compile the sass file since i couldn't install gulp on my machine, for some weird reasons</li>
<h2> With embedded recommended Fiverr gigs</h2>
<h2> I plan on rebuilding this using React.js and Tailwind</h2>
<li> Will do as soon as i master it</li>
